#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - increase at steady rate as n get bigger, a in while loop is at n^2 and will take n steps to catch up to n^3

b) O(n^2) - increase quadratically because of nested loops

c) O(n) - run at a steady rate, subtract 1 for each recursive calls

## Exercise II

Person can start at first floor, then goes to each floor and drops an egg, if it doesnt break move to next floor, if on the next floor and egg break you stop, you know the floor before is the floor where eggs do not break.

O(n)
